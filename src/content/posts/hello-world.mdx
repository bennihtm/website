Hey you! Welcome to my website! I dont know how you did, but I'm glad you found me here.

I'm Benjamin, as you might have already gathered from the title of this very website. I'd like to use the moment to introduce myself a little bit.

**I'm 19 years old, living in Germany and I'm currently busy with my Abitur** (the US equivalent would be a high school diploma).
In my spare time, I enjoy going outside and taking in the beautiful nature around me, listening to music and getting some steps in. 
When im not outside, I usually play video games, chat with friends on Discord or work on [my projects](/projects/).

**The most important thing to know about me is that I am a Christian.** I believe that there is a loving God and he wants to have a relationship with us. With me. And with you.
I believe that he sent his only son, Jesus Christ, onto this earth to die for our sins, to bridge the gap we created between him and us. And that he rose again to defeat death and to let us live in community with him again.
Just out of the love he has for us.

That is something I try to live by. I want to reflect the love Jesus shows me to the people around me. 
I aim to do that in every day conversations and the interactions I have with people, as well as in how I live my life and in the projects I start in my spare time.

My favorite bible verse (my life verse, if you will) is Isaiah 55:8-9:
> For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, declares the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.

That's something I know from experience. [God works in my life, and he does it in ways I would have never even thought of being possible.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol4Lj4vpzLs)

At the time of writing, my favorite song is this one:

Thats prone to change, though. If you want to check out some of the other music I listen to, feel free to stalk my [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/6b4663f8x9uqhx0dhhq4hh00q) profile.

Finally, I just have this to say:
Have a great morning, afternoon or evening, wherever you are!

Jesus loves you. ❤️
