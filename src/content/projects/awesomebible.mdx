## Summary
awesomeBible is a blogging project with the goal of reaching people that don't know of the, frankly quite awesome, plan that God has for their lives.

The project has a few spin-offs, like a bible app with focus on note-taking and explanations in easily understandable language.

## History

In 2016 I started a Blogger blog. It had no real aim, or vision. On there, I just shared bible verses that stuck out to me, and ocasionally I added my thoughts.
I continuted that over a the timespan of a few years, when I eventually moved the blog to a WordPress instance hosted by Automattic's WordPress.com.

Through the move, the vision for what was now called "Bibel4000site" grew bigger. It wasn't just sharing bible verses and my occasional thoughts on them.
It grew into me writing devotionals focused around those bible verses and just generally a more open formula that helped me grow as a writer.

Due to the ad-riddled WordPress.com site, the fact that I wanted to look a little more professional than being a ``.wordpress.com``-subdomain and just general limitations around the platform, I decided to move to a self-hosted WordPress instance.

That was the birth of awesomeBible.de. That wasn't the end though. There was still a lot more to come.
With now having access to a webspace that could run custom PHP scripts, I started to dabble in that.

I built *awesomeBible Verse*, a basic PHP script that displayed an image with a bible verse for each day of the year. 
Eventually, I started building a bible app - *my.awesomeBible* with the motivation to create an alternative to the existing apps. One that offers advanced note-taking functionality, works fully offline, is completely open source and self-hostable and free of tracking.

awesomeBible has [one goal](https://docs.awesomebible.de/en/vision/):

> We want to inspire people about God’s awesome plan, that’s why we explain the Bible in a simple, understandable and accessible way for everyone!
